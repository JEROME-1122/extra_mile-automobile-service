              <h4>AC Service</h4>
              <p>When you take your car for
              a car AC service, the 
              technician starts by checking 
              the cabin temperature while
              operating the AC. It should
              be approximately 5°C-10°C.

              shield for your car and hence
              it is very important to protect 
              it and even invest in the best.

              <h4>Engine Diagnostics</h4>
              <p>Car diagnostic tests scan your 
              car's components and systems 
              to check for issues with 
              components like the engine, 
              transmission, oil tank, throttle, 
              and many more. Because car 
              diagnostic tests require 
              specific devices.

              <h4>Full Service</h4>
              <p>A full service usually 
              comprises extra 15-30
              additional checks on the car's 
              components in comparison to 
              the basic servicing. Also, 
              along with the basic 
              service, if the car requires any
              additional maintenance work, 
              there's an additional cost.

              <h4>Anti-lock Break Service</h4>
              <p>The primary job of the Anti 
              Lock Braking System or ABS 
              is to monitor our vehicle's 
              wheels under heavy braking. 
              As a result, every car with ABS
              has a sensor attached to its 
              wheels.  Whenever the sensors 
              detect that your car or bike 
              wheels are beginning to lock 
              up.

              <h4>Performance Upgrades</h4>
              <p>The 'performance' in high-
              performance cars refers to their 
              powerful engines, superior 
              speed, agility, and overall 
              driving experience. While 
              regular cars have moderately 
              powerful engines that are easier 
              to handle, performance and 
              sports cars need powerful 
              engines to provide higher 
              performance.

              <h4>Lube , oil and filter</h4>
              <p>Together, the oil and oil filter 
              keep your vehicle's engine 
              operating at optimal levels of 
              performance. During an oil 
              change, we will replace your 
              engine's old oil with new oil 
              and replace the oil filter. We 
              will also lubricate the chassis 
              components of the vehicle 
              according to the standards of 
              the manufacturer.

              <h4>Computer Diagnostic</h4>
              <p>Car diagnostic tests scan your

              diagnostic tests require specific 
              devices and expertise to read 
              correctly, most tests are 
              performed with mechanics 
              or at dealer shops.
